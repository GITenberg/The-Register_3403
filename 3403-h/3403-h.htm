REGISTER.<br />
Farce.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: In an upper chamber of a
boarding-house in Melanchthon Place, Boston, a mature, plain
young lady, with every appearance of establishing herself in the
room for the first time, moves about, bestowing little touches of
decoration here and there, and talking with another young lady,
whose voice comes through the open doorway of an inner room.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Miss Ethel Reed</i>, from within: &ldquo;What in the world
are you doing, Nettie?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Henrietta Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Oh, sticking up a
household god or two.&nbsp; What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Despairing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Still?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, tragically: &ldquo;Still!&nbsp; How soon did
you expect me to stop?&nbsp; I am here on the sofa, where I flung
myself two hours ago, and I don&rsquo;t <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>think I
shall ever get up.&nbsp; There is no reason <i>why</i> I ever
should.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, suggestively: &ldquo;Dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, dinner!&nbsp; Dinner, to a broken
heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe your heart
is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;But I tell you it is!&nbsp; I ought
to know when my own heart is broken, I should hope.&nbsp; What
makes you think it isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s happened so
often!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;But this is a real case.&nbsp; You
ought to feel my forehead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;You ought to get up and help me
put this room to rights, and then you would feel
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;No; I should feel worse.&nbsp; The
idea of household gods makes me sick.&nbsp; Sylvan deities are
what I want; the great god Pan among the cat-tails and
arrow-heads in the &lsquo;ma&rsquo;sh&rsquo; at Ponkwasset; the
dryads of the birch woods&mdash;there are no oaks; the nymphs
that haunt the heights and hollows of the dear old mountain;
the&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Wha-a-at?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
hear a word you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you keep
fussing about so.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you be quiet, if you want
to hear?&rdquo;&nbsp; She lifts her voice to its highest pitch,
with a pause for distinctness between the words: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
heart-broken for&mdash;Ponkwasset.&nbsp; The dryads&mdash;of
the&mdash;birch woods.&nbsp; The nymphs&mdash;and the
great&mdash;god&mdash;Pan&mdash;in the reeds&mdash;by the
river.&nbsp; And all&mdash;that&mdash;sort
of&mdash;thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;You know very well you&rsquo;re
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the
reason I&rsquo;m not?&nbsp; Then, what am I heart-broken
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not heart-broken at
all.&nbsp; You know very well that he&rsquo;ll call before
we&rsquo;ve been here twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;The great god Pan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, how cruel you are, to mock me
so!&nbsp; Come in here, and sympathize a little!&nbsp; Do,
Nettie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;No; you come out here and
utilize a little.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m acting for your best good, as
they say at Ponkwasset.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;When they want to be
disagreeable!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;If this room isn&rsquo;t
in order by the time he calls, you&rsquo;ll be everlastingly
disgraced.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that now.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t be more so&mdash;there&rsquo;s that comfort.&nbsp;
What makes you think he&rsquo;ll call?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s a gentleman,
and will want to apologize.&nbsp; He behaved very rudely to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;No, Nettie; <i>I</i> behaved rudely
to <i>him</i>.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Besides, if he behaved rudely, he
was no gentleman.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a contradiction in terms,
don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m
going to do if he comes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to show a proper
spirit for once in my life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to refuse to
see him.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Why nonsense?&nbsp; Oh, why?&nbsp;
Expound!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Because he wasn&rsquo;t rude to
me, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to see me.&nbsp; Because I&rsquo;m
plain, and you&rsquo;re pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i>!&nbsp; You know
it perfectly well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hideous.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m poor, and
you&rsquo;re a person of independent property.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;<i>Dependent</i> property, I
should call it: just enough to be useless on!&nbsp; But
that&rsquo;s insulting to <i>him</i>.&nbsp; How can you say
it&rsquo;s because I have a little money?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Well, then, I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
I take it back.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s because
you&rsquo;re young, and I&rsquo;m old.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>not</i> old.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re as young as anybody, Nettie Spaulding.&nbsp; And you
know I&rsquo;m not young; I&rsquo;m twenty-seven, if I&rsquo;m a
day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just dropping into the grave.&nbsp; But I
can&rsquo;t argue with you, miles off so, any
longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Reed</i> appears at the open door,
dragging languidly after her the shawl which she had evidently
drawn round her on the sofa; her fair hair is a little
disordered, and she presses it into shape with one hand as she
comes forward; a lovely flush vies with a heavenly pallor in her
cheeks; she looks a little pensive in the arching eyebrows, and a
little humorous about the dimpled mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I can
prove that you are entirely wrong.&nbsp; Where&mdash;were
you?&mdash;This room is rather an improvement over the one we had
last winter.&nbsp; There is more of a view&rdquo;&mdash;she goes
to the window&mdash;&ldquo;of the houses across the Place; and I
always think the <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>swell front gives a pretty shape to a room.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sorry they&rsquo;ve stopped building them.&nbsp; Your
piano goes very nicely into that little alcove.&nbsp; Yes,
we&rsquo;re quite palatial.&nbsp; And, on the whole, I&rsquo;m
glad there&rsquo;s no fireplace.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pleasure at
times; but for the most part it&rsquo;s a vanity and a vexation,
getting dust and ashes over everything.&nbsp; Yes; after all,
give me the good old-fashioned, clean, convenient register!&nbsp;
Ugh!&nbsp; My feet are like ice.&rdquo;&nbsp; She pulls an
easy-chair up to the register in the corner of the room, and
pushes open its valves with the toe of her slipper.&nbsp; As she
settles herself luxuriously in the chair, and poises her feet
daintily over the register: &ldquo;Ah, this is something
like!&nbsp; Henrietta Spaulding, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; Did I ever
tell you that you were the best friend I have in the
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, who continues her work of arranging the
room: &ldquo;Often.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Did you ever believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, thoughtfully regarding a vase which she
holds in her hand, after several times shifting it from a bracket
to the corner of her <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>piano and back: &ldquo;I wish I
could tell where you do look best!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, leaning forward wistfully, with her hands
clasped and resting on her knees: &ldquo;I wish you would tell me
<i>why</i> you don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re the best friend I
have in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, finally placing the vase on the
bracket: &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve said so too
often.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s no reason!&nbsp; I
can prove to you that you are.&nbsp; Who else but you would have
taken in a homeless and friendless creature like me, and let her
stay bothering round in demoralizing idleness, while you were
seriously teaching the young idea how to drub the
piano?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Anybody who wanted a room-mate
as much as I did, and could have found one willing to pay more
than her share of the lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, thoughtfully: &ldquo;Do you think so,
Henrietta?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;I know so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not afraid that you
wrong yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Not the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Well, be it so&mdash;as they
say in novels.&nbsp; I will not contradict you; I will not say
you are my <i>best</i> friend; I will merely say that you are my
<i>only</i> friend.&nbsp; Come here, Henrietta.&nbsp; Draw up
your chair, and put your little hand in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, with severe distrust: &ldquo;What do
you want, Ethel Reed?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I want&mdash;I want&mdash;to talk it
over with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, recoiling: &ldquo;I knew it!&nbsp;
Well, now, we&rsquo;ve talked it over enough; we&rsquo;ve talked
it over till there&rsquo;s nothing left of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s everything
left!&nbsp; It remains in all its original enormity.&nbsp;
Perhaps we shall get some new light upon it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
extends a pleading hand towards <i>Miss Spaulding</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, Henrietta, my only friend, shake!&mdash;as the
&lsquo;good Indians&rsquo; say.&nbsp; Let your Ethel pour her
hackneyed sorrows into your bosom.&nbsp; Such an uncomfortable
image, it always seems, doesn&rsquo;t it, pouring sorrows into
bosoms!&nbsp; Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, decidedly: &ldquo;No, I
won&rsquo;t!&nbsp; And you needn&rsquo;t try wheedling any
longer.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t sympathize with you on that basis at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;What shall I try, then, if you
won&rsquo;t let me try wheedling?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, going to the piano and opening it:
&ldquo;Try courage; try self-respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, dear! when I haven&rsquo;t a
morsel of either.&nbsp; Are you going to practise, you cruel
maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Of course I am.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
half-past four, and if I don&rsquo;t do it now I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be prepared to-morrow for Miss Robins: she
takes this piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Well, well, perhaps it&rsquo;s all
for the best.&nbsp; If music be the food
of&mdash;umph-ump!&mdash;you know what!&mdash;play
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; They both laugh, and <i>Miss Spaulding</i>
pushes back a little from the piano, and wheels toward her
friend, letting one hand rest slightly on the keys.</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Ethel Reed, you&rsquo;re the
most ridiculous girl in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Correct!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe you
ever were in love, or ever will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Ah, there you wrong me,
Henrietta!&nbsp; I have been, and I shall be&mdash;lots of
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Well, what do you want to
say now?&nbsp; You must hurry, for I can&rsquo;t lose any more
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I will free my mind with neatness and
despatch.&nbsp; I simply wish to go over the whole affair, from
Alfred to Omaha; and you&rsquo;ve got to let me talk as much
slang and nonsense as I want.&nbsp; And then I&rsquo;ll skip all
the details I can.&nbsp; Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, with impatient patience: &ldquo;Oh, I
suppose so!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very sweet of you,
though you don&rsquo;t look it.&nbsp; Now, where was I?&nbsp; Oh,
yes, do you think it was forth-putting at all, to ask him if he
would give me the lessons?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;It depends upon why you asked
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I asked him from&mdash;from&mdash;Let
me see; I asked him because&mdash;from&mdash;Yes, I say it
boldly; I asked him from an enthusiasm for art, and a sincere
wish to learn the use of oil, as he called it.&nbsp;
Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Sure?&nbsp; Well, we will say that I
am, for the sake of argument.&nbsp; And, having <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>secured
this basis, the question is whether I wasn&rsquo;t bound to offer
him pay at the end, and whether he wasn&rsquo;t wrong to take my
doing so in dudgeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Yes, I think he was wrong.&nbsp;
And the terms of his refusal were very ungentlemanly.&nbsp; He
ought to apologize most amply and humbly.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a
certain expression in <i>Miss Reed&rsquo;s</i> face, she adds,
with severity: &ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re keeping back the main
point.&nbsp; You usually do.&nbsp; Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told you
everything&mdash;everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Then I say, as I said from the
beginning, that he behaved very badly.&nbsp; It was very awkward
and very painful, but you&rsquo;ve really nothing to blame
yourself for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, ruefully: &ldquo;No-o-o!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;What do you mean by that sort of
&lsquo;No&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, sternly: &ldquo;Yes, you do,
Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, really.&nbsp; What
makes you&rsquo; think I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;It sounded very
dishonest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Did it?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
mean it to.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her friend breaks down with a laugh,
while <i>Miss Reed</i> preserves a demure countenance.</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;What <i>are</i> you keeping
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Nothing at all&mdash;less than
nothing!&nbsp; I never thought it was worth
mentioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Are you telling me the
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the truth and
something more.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t ask better than that, can
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, turning to her music again:
&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: in a pathetic wail: &ldquo;O Henrietta! do
you abandon me thus?&nbsp; Well, I will tell you, heartless
girl!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only kept it back till now because it was
so extremely mortifying to my pride as an artist&mdash;as a
student of oil.&nbsp; Will you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, beginning to play:
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, with burlesque wildness: &ldquo;You
shall!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Spaulding</i> involuntarily
desists.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was a moment&mdash;a fatal
moment&mdash;when he said he thought he ought to tell me that if
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>I found
oil amusing I could go on; but that he didn&rsquo;t believe I
should ever learn to use it, and he couldn&rsquo;t let me take
lessons from him with the expectation that I should.&nbsp;
There!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, with awful reproach: &ldquo;And you
call that less than nothing?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve almost a mind never
to speak to you again, Ethel.&nbsp; How <i>could</i> you deceive
me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Was it really deceiving?&nbsp;
<i>I</i> shouldn&rsquo;t call it so.&nbsp; And I needed your
sympathy so much, and I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t get it unless you
thought I was altogether in the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;You are altogether in the
wrong!&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s <i>you</i> that ought to apologize to
<i>him</i>&mdash;on your bended knees.&nbsp; How <i>could</i> you
offer him money after that?&nbsp; I wonder at you,
Ethel!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Why&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see,
Nettie?&mdash;I did keep on taking the lessons of him.&nbsp; I
did find oil amusing&mdash;or the oilist&mdash;and I kept
on.&nbsp; Of course I had to, off there in a farmhouse full of
lady boarders, and he the only gentleman short of
Crawford&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Strike, but hear me, Henrietta
Spaulding!&nbsp; What was I to do about the half-dozen lessons I
had taken before he told me I <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>should never learn to use oil?&nbsp;
Was I to offer to pay him for these, and not for the rest; or was
I to treat the whole series as gratuitous?&nbsp; I used to lie
awake thinking about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got little tact, but I
couldn&rsquo;t find any way out of the trouble.&nbsp; It was a
box&mdash;yes, a box of the deepest dye!&nbsp; And the whole
affair having got to be&mdash;something else, don&rsquo;t you
know?&mdash;made it all the worse.&nbsp; And if he&rsquo;d
only&mdash;only&mdash;But he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Not a syllable,
not a breath!&nbsp; And there I was.&nbsp; I <i>had</i> to offer
him the money.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s almost killed me&mdash;the
way he took my offering it, and now the way you take it!&nbsp;
And it&rsquo;s all of a piece.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Reed</i>
suddenly snatches her handkerchief from her pocket, and buries
her face in it.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear!&nbsp;
Oh!&mdash;hu, hu, hu!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, relenting: &ldquo;It was
awkward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Awkward!&nbsp; You seem to think that
because I carry things off lightly I have no feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t think
that, Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, pursuing her advantage: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know it from you, Nettie.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried and <i>tried</i>
to <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>pass
it off as a joke, and to treat it as something funny; but I can
tell you it&rsquo;s no joke at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, sympathetically: &ldquo;I see,
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I care for
him&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Why, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;For I don&rsquo;t in the least.&nbsp;
He is horrid every way: blunt, and rude, and horrid.&nbsp; I
never cared for him.&nbsp; But I care for myself!&nbsp; He has
put me in the position of having done an unkind thing&mdash;an
unladylike thing&mdash;when I was only doing what I had to
do.&nbsp; Why need he have taken it the way he did?&nbsp; Why
couldn&rsquo;t he have said politely that he couldn&rsquo;t
accept the money because he hadn&rsquo;t earned it?&nbsp; Even
<i>that</i> would have been mortifying enough.&nbsp; But he must
go and be so violent, and rush off, and&mdash;Oh, I never could
have treated anybody so!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Not unless you were very fond of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Not unless you were very fond of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, putting away her handkerchief: &ldquo;Oh,
nonsense, Nettie!&nbsp; He never cared anything for me, or he
couldn&rsquo;t have acted so.&nbsp; But no <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>matter for
that.&nbsp; He has fixed everything so that it can never be got
straight&mdash;never in the world.&nbsp; It will just have to
remain a hideous mass of&mdash;of&mdash;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know
what; and I have simply got to on withering with despair at the
point where I left off.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t care!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s one comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
he&rsquo;ll let you wither long, Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s let me wither for
twenty-four hours already!&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s nothing to me,
now, how long he lets me wither.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m perfectly
satisfied to have the affair remain as it is.&nbsp; I am in the
right, and if he comes I shall refuse to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Oh, no, you won&rsquo;t,
Ethel!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Yes, I shall.&nbsp; I shall receive
him very coldly.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t listen to any excuse from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Oh, yes, you will,
Ethel!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;No, I shall not.&nbsp; If he wishes
me to listen he must begin by humbling himself in the
dust&mdash;yes, the dust, Nettie!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t take
anything short of it.&nbsp; I insist that he shall realize that I
have suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Perhaps he has suffered
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, <i>he</i>
suffered!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;You know that he was perfectly
devoted to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;He never said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t
dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;He dared to be very insolent to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;And you know you liked him very
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you say that,
Nettie Spaulding.&nbsp; I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> like him.&nbsp; I
respected and admired him; but I didn&rsquo;t <i>like</i>
him.&nbsp; He will come near me; but if he does he has to begin
by&mdash;by&mdash;Let me see, what shall I make him begin by
doing?&rdquo;&nbsp; She casts up her eyes for inspiration while
she leans forward over the register.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I
will!&nbsp; He has got to begin by taking that money!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Ethel, you wouldn&rsquo;t put
that affront upon a sensitive and high-spirited man!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; You wait and
<i>see</i>, Miss Spaulding!&nbsp; He shall take the money, and he
shall sign a receipt for it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll draw up the receipt
now, so as to have it ready, and I shall ask him to sign it the
very moment he enters this <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>door&mdash;the very
instant!&rdquo;&nbsp; She takes a portfolio from the table near
her, without rising, and writes: &ldquo;&lsquo;Received from Miss
Ethel Reed one hundred and twenty-five dollars, in full, for
twenty-five lessons in oil-painting.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There&mdash;when Mr. Oliver Ransom has signed this little
document he may begin to talk; not before!&rdquo;&nbsp; She leans
back in her chair with an air of pitiless determination.</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;But, Ethel, you don&rsquo;t mean
to make him take money for the lessons he gave you after he told
you you couldn&rsquo;t learn anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, after a moment&rsquo;s pause: &ldquo;Yes, I
do.&nbsp; This is to punish him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish for
justice now; I wish for vengeance!&nbsp; At first I would have
compromised on the six lessons, or on none at all, if he had
behaved nicely; but after what&rsquo;s happened I shall insist
upon paying him for every lesson, so as to make him feel that the
whole thing, from first to last, was a purely business
transaction on my part.&nbsp; Yes, a <i>purely</i>&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">BUSINESS</span>&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">TRANSACTION</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, turning to her music: &ldquo;Then
I&rsquo;ve got nothing more to say to you, Ethel Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say but what,
after he&rsquo;s taken the money and signed the receipt,
I&rsquo;ll listen to anything else he&rsquo;s got to say, very
willingly.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Spaulding</i> makes no answer,
but begins to play with a scientific absorption, feeling her way
fitfully through the new piece, while <i>Miss Reed</i>, seated by
the register, trifles with the book she has taken from the
table.</p>
<h3><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> interior of the room of <i>Miss
Spaulding</i> and <i>Miss Reed</i> remains in view, while the
scene discloses, on the other side of the partition wall in the
same house, the bachelor apartment of <i>Mr. Samuel
Grinnidge</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mr. Grinnidge</i> in his dressing-gown
and slippers, with his pipe in his mouth, has the effect of
having just come in; his friend <i>Mr. Oliver Ransom</i> stands
at the window, staring out into the November weather.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;How long have you been waiting
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Ten minutes&mdash;ten years.&nbsp; How
should I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know who else
should.&nbsp; Get back to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Well, take off your coat, and pull up
to the register, and warm your poor feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; He puts
his hand out over the register.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>it!
somebody&rsquo;s got the register open in the next room!&nbsp;
You see, one pipe comes up from the furnace and branches into a V
just under the floor, and professes to heat both rooms.&nbsp; But
it don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There was a fellow in there last winter who
used to get all my heat.&nbsp; Used to go out and leave his
register open, and I&rsquo;d come in here just before dinner and
find this place as cold as a barn.&nbsp; We had a running fight
of it all winter.&nbsp; The man who got his register open first
in the morning got all the heat for the day, for it never turned
the other way when it started in one direction.&nbsp; Used to
almost suffocate&mdash;warm, muggy days&mdash;maintaining my
rights.&nbsp; Some piano-pounder in there this winter, it
seems.&nbsp; Hear?&nbsp; And she hasn&rsquo;t lost any time in
learning the trick of the register.&nbsp; What kept you so late
in the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, after an absent-minded pause: &ldquo;Grinnidge,
I wish you would give me some advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;You can have all you want of it at
the market price.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean your legal
advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&nbsp; What have you
been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making an ass of
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that rather
superfluous?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;If you please, yes.&nbsp; But now, it
you&rsquo;re capable of listening to me without any further
display of your cross-examination wit, I should like to tell you
how it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;I will do my best to veil my
brilliancy.&nbsp; Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I went up to Ponkwasset early in
September for the foliage.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;And staid till late in October.&nbsp;
There must have been a reason for that.&nbsp; What was her
name?&nbsp; Foliage?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, coming up to the corner of the chimney-piece,
near which his friend sits, and talking to him directly over the
register: &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll have to get along without
the name for the present.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you by and
by.&rdquo;&nbsp; As <i>Mr. Ransom</i> pronounces these words,
<i>Miss Reed</i>, on her side of the partition, lifts her head
with a startled air, and, after a moment of vague circumspection,
listens keenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But she was beautiful.&nbsp; She was
a blonde, and she had the loveliest eyes&mdash;eyes, you know,
that could be funny or tender, just as she chose&mdash;the kind
of eyes I always liked.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Reed</i> leads
forward over the register.&nbsp; &ldquo;She <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>had one of
those faces that always leave you in doubt whether they&rsquo;re
laughing at you, and so keep you in wholesome subjection; but you
feel certain that they&rsquo;re <i>good</i>, and that if they did
hurt you by laughing at you, they&rsquo;d look sorry for you
afterward.&nbsp; When she walked you saw what an exquisite
creature she was.&nbsp; It always made me mad to think I
couldn&rsquo;t <i>paint</i> her walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;I suppose you saw a good deal of her
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Yes; we were off in the woods and fields
half the time together.&rdquo;&nbsp; He takes a turn towards the
window.</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, suddenly shutting the register on her side:
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, looking up from her music: &ldquo;What
is it, Ethel?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Nothing, nothing;
I&mdash;I&mdash;thought it was getting too warm.&nbsp; Go on,
dear; don&rsquo;t let me interrupt you.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a
moment of heroic self-denial she softly presses the register open
with her foot.</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, coming back to the register: &ldquo;It all
began in that way.&nbsp; I had the good fortune one day to rescue
her from a&mdash;cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, for shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, desisting from her piano: &ldquo;What
<i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, clapping the register to: &ldquo;This
ridiculous book!&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind me,
Nettie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Breathlessly:
&ldquo;Go&mdash;go&mdash;on!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Spaulding</i>
resumes, and again <i>Miss Reed</i> softly presses the register
open.</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, after a pause: &ldquo;The cow was grazing, and
had no more thought of hooking Miss&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t suppose he
<i>would</i>!&mdash;Go on, Nettie, go on!&nbsp; The
hero&mdash;<i>such</i> a goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I drove her away with my camp-stool, and
Miss&mdash;the young lady&mdash;was as grateful as if I had
rescued her from a menagerie of wild animals.&nbsp; I walked home
with her to the farm house, and the trouble began at
once.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pantomime of indignant protest and burlesque
menace on the part of <i>Miss Reed</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
wasn&rsquo;t another well woman in the house, except her friend
Miss Spaulding, who was rather old and rather plain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He takes another turn to the window.</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; She shuts the
register, but instantly opens it again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Louder,
Nettie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, in astonishment:
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Did I speak?&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t know it.&nbsp; I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, desisting from practice: &ldquo;What is
that strange, hollow, rumbling, mumbling kind of
noise?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, softly closing the register with her foot:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear any strange, hollow, rumbling, mumbling
kind of noise.&nbsp; Do you hear it <i>now</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;No.&nbsp; It was the Brighton
whistle, probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, very likely.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
<i>Miss Spaulding</i> turns again to her practice <i>Miss
Reed</i> re-opens the register and listens again.&nbsp; A little
interval of silence ensues, while <i>Ransom</i> lights a
cigarette.</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;So you sought opportunities of
rescuing her from other cows?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, returning: &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t
necessary.&nbsp; The young lady was so impressed by my behavior,
that she asked if I would give her some lessons in the use of
oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;She thought if she knew how to paint
pictures like yours she wouldn&rsquo;t need any one to drive the
cows away.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be farcical,
Grinnidge.&nbsp; That sort of thing will do with some victim on
the <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>witness-stand who can&rsquo;t help himself.&nbsp; Of
course I said I would, and we were off half the time together,
painting the loveliest and loneliest bits around
Ponkwasset.&nbsp; It all went on very well, till one day I felt
bound in conscience to tell her that I didn&rsquo;t think she
would ever learn to paint, and that&mdash;if she was serious
about it she&rsquo;d better drop it at once, for she was wasting
her time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>, getting up to fill his pipe: &ldquo;That was
a pleasant thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I told her that if it amused her, to
keep on; I would be only too glad to give her all&mdash;the hints
I could, but that I oughtn&rsquo;t to encourage her.&nbsp; She
seemed a good deal hurt.&nbsp; I fancied at the time that she
thought I was tired of having her with me so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, <i>did</i> you,
indeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; To <i>Miss Spaulding</i>, who bends an
astonished glance upon her from the piano: &ldquo;The man in this
book is the most <i>conceited</i> creature, Nettie.&nbsp; Play
chords&mdash;something very subdued&mdash;ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;What are you talking about,
Ethel?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;That was at night; but the next day she
came up smiling, and said that if I didn&rsquo;t mind <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>she would
keep on&mdash;for amusement; she wasn&rsquo;t a bit
discouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Go on, Nettie; don&rsquo;t
let my outbursts interrupt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I used to fancy sometimes that she was a
little sweet on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;You wretch!&mdash;Oh, scales,
Nettie!&nbsp; Play scales!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Ethel Reed, are you
crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, after a thoughtful moment: &ldquo;Well, so it
went on for the next seven or eight weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we
weren&rsquo;t sketching in the meadows, or on the mountain-side,
or in the old punt on the pond, we were walking up and down the
farmhouse piazza together.&nbsp; She used to read to me when I
was at work.&nbsp; She had a heavenly voice,
Grinnidge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, you silly, silly
thing!&mdash;Really this book makes me sick, Nettie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Well, the long and the short of it was,
I was hit&mdash;<i>hard</i>, and I lost all courage.&nbsp; You
know how I am, Grinnidge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, softly: &ldquo;Oh, poor fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;So I let the time go by, and at the end
I hadn&rsquo;t said anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;No, sir!&nbsp; You
<i>hadn&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Spaulding</i> gradually
ceases to play, and fixes her attention wholly upon <i>Miss
Reed</i>, who bends forward over the register with an intensely
excited face.</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Then something happened that made me
glad, for twenty-four hours at least, that I hadn&rsquo;t
spoken.&nbsp; She sent me the money for twenty-five
lessons.&nbsp; Imagine how I felt, Grinnidge!&nbsp; What could I
suppose but that she had been quietly biding her time, and
storing up her resentment for my having told her she
couldn&rsquo;t learn to paint, till she could pay me back with
interest in one supreme insult?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, in a low voice: &ldquo;Oh, how could you
think such a cruel, vulgar thing?&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss
Spaulding</i> leaves the piano, and softly approaches her, where
she has sunk on her knees beside the register.</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;It was tantamount to telling me that she
had been amusing herself with me instead of my lessons.&nbsp; It
remanded our whole association, which I had got to thinking so
romantic, to the relation of teacher and pupil.&nbsp; It was a
snub&mdash;a heartless, killing snub; and I couldn&rsquo;t see it
in any <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>other light.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Ransom</i> walks away to
the window, and looks out.</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, flinging herself backward from the register,
and hiding her face in her hands: &ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t! it
wasn&rsquo;t! it wasn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; How could you think
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, rushing forward, and catching her
friend in her arms: &ldquo;What is the matter with you, Ethel
Reed?&nbsp; What are you doing here, over the register?&nbsp; Are
you trying to suffocate yourself?&nbsp; Have you taken leave of
your senses?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Our fair friend on the other side of
the wall seems to be on the rampage.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, shutting the register with a violent
clash: &ldquo;Ugh! how hot it is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t like your conversation,
apparently.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, frantically pressing forward to open the
register: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t shut it, Nettie, dear!&nbsp; If
you do I shall die!&nbsp; Do-o-n&rsquo;t shut the
register!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shut it?&nbsp; Why,
we&rsquo;ve got all the heat of the furnace in the room
now.&nbsp; Surely you don&rsquo;t want any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;No, no; not any more.&nbsp;
But&mdash;<a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>but&mdash;&nbsp; Oh, dear! what shall I
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; She still struggles in the embrace of her
friend.</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>, remaining quietly at the register, while
<i>Ransom</i> walks away to the window: &ldquo;Well, what did you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;There, there!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
commencing again!&nbsp; <i>Do</i> open it, Nettie.&nbsp; I
<i>will</i> have it open!&rdquo;&nbsp; She wrenches herself free,
and dashes the register open.</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s opened it
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, in a stage-whisper: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
other one!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, from the window: &ldquo;Do?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you what I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ol&mdash;Mr.
Ransom.&nbsp; And, oh, I can&rsquo;t make out what he&rsquo;s
saying!&nbsp; He must have gone away to the other side of the
room&mdash;and it&rsquo;s at the most important point!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, in an awful undertone: &ldquo;Was that
the hollow rumbling I heard?&nbsp; And have you been listening at
the register to what they&rsquo;ve been saying?&nbsp; O
<i>Ethel</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been listening,
exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;You have!&nbsp; You have been
eavesdropping!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Eavesdropping is listening
through a key-hole, or around a corner.&nbsp; This is very
different.&nbsp; Besides, it&rsquo;s Oliver, and he&rsquo;s been
talking about <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Hark!&rdquo;&nbsp; She clutches
her friend&rsquo;s hand, where they have crouched upon the floor
together, and pulls her forward to the register.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
dear, how hot it is!&nbsp; I wish they would cut off the heat
down below.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>, smoking peacefully through the silence which
his friend has absent-mindedly let follow upon his last words:
&ldquo;Well, you seem disposed to take your time about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;About what?&nbsp; Oh, yes!&nbsp;
Well&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&nbsp; Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t listen!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s shameful: it&rsquo;s wicked!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see
how you can do it, Ethel!&rdquo;&nbsp; She remains, however,
kneeling near the register, and she involuntarily inclines a
little more toward it.</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;&mdash;It isn&rsquo;t a thing that I
care to shout from the house-tops.&rdquo;&nbsp; He returns from
the window to the chimney-piece.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wrote the rudest
kind of note, and sent back her letter and her money in it.&nbsp;
She had said that she hoped our acquaintance was not to end with
the summer, but that we might <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>sometimes meet in Boston; and I
answered that our acquaintance had ended already, and that I
should be sorry to meet her anywhere again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Well, if you wanted to make an ass of
yourself, you did it pretty completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, whispering: &ldquo;How witty he is!&nbsp;
Those men are always so humorous with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Yes; I didn&rsquo;t do it by
halves.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, whispering: &ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i>
funny, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t occur to you that she
might feel bound to pay you for the first half-dozen, and was
embarrassed how to offer to pay for them alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;How he <i>does</i> go to the heart of
the matter!&rdquo;&nbsp; She presses <i>Miss
Spaulding&rsquo;s</i> hand in an ecstasy of approval.</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Yes, it did&mdash;afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, in a tender murmur: &ldquo;Oh, <i>poor</i>
Oliver!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;And it occurred to me that she was
perfectly right in the whole affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, how generous! how
noble!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I had had a thousand opportunities, <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>and I
hadn&rsquo;t been man enough to tell her that I was in love with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;How can he say it right out so
bluntly?&nbsp; But if it&rsquo;s true&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> speak.&nbsp; I
was afraid of putting an end to the affair&mdash;of frightening
her&mdash;disgusting her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, how little they know us,
Nettie!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;She seemed so much above me in every
way&mdash;so sensitive, so refined, so gentle, so good, so
angelic!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;There!&nbsp; <i>Now</i> do you call
it eavesdropping?&nbsp; If listeners never hear any good of
themselves, what do you say to that?&nbsp; It proves that I
haven&rsquo;t been listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
saying something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;But all that&rsquo;s neither here nor
there.&nbsp; I can see now that under the circumstances she
couldn&rsquo;t as a lady have acted otherwise than she did.&nbsp;
She was forced to treat our whole acquaintance as a business
matter, and I had forced her to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;You <i>had</i>, you poor
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Well, what do you intend to do
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I want to
submit to you, Grinnidge.&nbsp; I must see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad <i>I</i>
mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, stifling a laugh on <i>Miss
Spaulding&rsquo;s</i> shoulder: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually
<i>afraid</i> of us, Nettie!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;See her, and go down in the
dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;My very words!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I have been trying to think what was the
very humblest pie I could eat, by way of penance; and it appears
to me that I had better begin by saying that I have come to ask
her for the money I refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, enraptured: &ldquo;Oh! doesn&rsquo;t it seem
just like&mdash;like&mdash;inspiration, Nettie?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&nbsp; Be quiet,
do!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll frighten them away!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;What then?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what
then.&nbsp; But it appears to me that, as a gentleman, <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>I&rsquo;ve
got nothing to do with the result.&nbsp; All that I&rsquo;ve got
to do is to submit to my fate, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, breathlessly: &ldquo;What princely
courage!&nbsp; What delicate magnanimity!&nbsp; Oh, he
needn&rsquo;t have the <i>least</i> fear!&nbsp; If I could only
tell him that!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>, after an interval of meditative smoking:
&ldquo;Yes, I guess that&rsquo;s the best thing you can do.&nbsp;
It will strike her fancy, if she&rsquo;s an imaginative girl, and
she&rsquo;ll think you a fine fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, the horrid thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;If you humble yourself to a woman at
all, do it thoroughly.&nbsp; If you go halfway down she&rsquo;ll
be tempted to push you the rest of the way.&nbsp; If you flatten
out at her feet to begin with, ten to one but she will pick you
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Yes, that was my idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, was it, indeed!&nbsp;
Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with her
picking me up or pushing me down.&nbsp; All that I&rsquo;ve got
to do is to go and surrender myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Well; I guess you
can&rsquo;t go too soon.&nbsp; I like your company; but I advise
you as a friend not to lose time.&nbsp; Where does she
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the remarkable part
of it: she lives in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i> and <i>Miss Spaulding</i>, in subdued chorus:
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>, taking his pipe out of his mouth in
astonishment: &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;I just came in here to give my good
resolutions a rest while I was screwing my courage up to ask for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;s
<i>very</i> humorous?&nbsp; Give his good resolutions a
rest!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way he <i>always</i>
talks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;You said you came for my
advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;So I did.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t
promise to act upon it.&nbsp; Well!&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes toward
the door.</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>, without troubling himself to rise:
&ldquo;Well, good luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;How droll they are with each
other!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you <i>like</i> to hear them talk?&nbsp;
Oh, I could listen all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>, calling after <i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t told me your duck&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Is <i>that</i> what they call
us?&nbsp; Duck!&nbsp; <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Do you think it&rsquo;s very
respectful, Nettie?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe I like it.&nbsp;
Or, yes, why not?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no harm&mdash;if I <i>am</i>
his duck!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, coming back: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t propose
to go shouting it round.&nbsp; Her name is Miss Reed&mdash;Ethel
Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;How <i>can</i> he?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Slender, willowy party, with a lot of
blond hair that looks as if it might be indigenous?&nbsp; Rather
pensive-looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Indigenous!&nbsp; I should hope
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But she isn&rsquo;t
pensive.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s awfully deep.&nbsp; It makes me
shudder to think how deep that girl is.&nbsp; And when I think of
my courage in daring to be in love with her&mdash;a stupid,
straightforward idiot like me&mdash;I begin to respect myself in
spite of being such an ass.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m off.&nbsp; If I
stay any longer I shall never go.&rdquo;&nbsp; He closes the door
after him, and <i>Miss Reed</i> instantly springs to her
feet.</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;ll have to go down to
the parlor and send up his name, and that just gives me time to
do the necessary prinking.&nbsp; You stay here and receive him,
Nettie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Never!&nbsp; After what&rsquo;s
happened <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>I can never look him in the face again.&nbsp; Oh, how
low, and mean, and guilty I feel!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, with surprise: &ldquo;Why, how droll!&nbsp;
Now <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t feel the least so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s very different
with <i>you</i>.&nbsp; <i>You&rsquo;re</i> in love with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;For shame, Nettie!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
<i>not</i> in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;And you can explain and justify
it.&nbsp; But I never can justify it to myself, much less to
him.&nbsp; Let me go, Ethel!&nbsp; I shall tell Mrs. McKnight
that we must change this room instantly.&nbsp; And just after
I&rsquo;d got it so nearly in order!&nbsp; Go down and receive
him in the parlor, Ethel.&nbsp; I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Receive him in the parlor!&nbsp; Why,
Nettie, dear, you&rsquo;re crazy!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to
<i>accept</i> him: and how can I accept him&mdash;with all the
consequences&mdash;in a public parlor?&nbsp; No, indeed!&nbsp; If
you won&rsquo;t meet him here for a moment, just to oblige me,
you can go into the other room.&nbsp; Or, no&mdash;you&rsquo;d be
listening to every word through the key-hole, you&rsquo;re so
demoralized!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I deserve your
contempt, Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span><i>Miss Reed</i>, laughing: &ldquo;You will have to go
out for a walk, you poor thing; and I&rsquo;m not going to have
you coming back in five or ten minutes.&nbsp; You have got to
stay out a good hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, running to get her things from the next
room: &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll stay out till midnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, responding to a tap at the door:
&ldquo;Ye-e-s!&nbsp; Come in!&mdash;You&rsquo;re caught,
Nettie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>A maid-servant</i>, appearing with a card: &ldquo;This
gentleman is asking for you in the parlor, Miss Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Ask him to come up here,
please.&mdash;Nettie!&nbsp; Nettie!&rdquo;&nbsp; She calls to her
friend in the next room.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming right up,
and if you don&rsquo;t run you&rsquo;re trapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>, re-appearing, cloaked and bonneted:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame <i>you</i>, Ethel, comparatively
speaking.&nbsp; You can say that everything is fair in
love.&nbsp; He will like it, and laugh at it in you, because
he&rsquo;ll like everything you&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; Besides,
you&rsquo;ve no principles, and I <i>have</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve lots of principles,
Nettie, but I&rsquo;ve no practice!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;No matter.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
no excuse for me.&nbsp; I listened simply because I was a <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>woman, and
couldn&rsquo;t help it; and, oh, what will he think of
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give you away; if you
really feel so badly&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Spaulding</i>: &ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> you think you can
keep from telling him, Ethel dear?&nbsp; Try!&nbsp; And I will be
your slave forever!&rdquo;&nbsp; Steps are heard on the stairs
outside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, there he comes!&rdquo;&nbsp; She dashes
out of the door, and closes it after her, a moment before the
maid-servant, followed by <i>Mr. Ransom</i>, taps at it.</p>
<h3><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Miss Reed</i> opens the
door, and receives <i>Mr. Ransom</i> with well-affected surprise
and state, suffering him to stand awkwardly on the threshold for
a moment.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>She</i>, coldly: &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Mr. Ransom!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, abruptly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, advancing a few paces into the room:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, indicating a chair: &ldquo;Will you sit
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;I must stand for the present.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve come to ask you for that money, Miss Reed, which I
refused yesterday, in terms that I blush to think of.&nbsp; I was
altogether and wholly in the wrong, and I&rsquo;m ready to offer
any imaginable apology or reparation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ready to
take the money and to sign a receipt, and then to be dismissed
with whatever ignominy you please.&nbsp; I deserve
anything&mdash;everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span><i>She</i>: &ldquo;The money?&nbsp; Excuse me; I
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m not
prepared to pay you the whole sum to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, hastily: &ldquo;Oh, no matter! no matter!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care for the money now.&nbsp; I merely wish
to&mdash;to assure you that I thought you were perfectly right in
offering it, and to&mdash;to&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; That
is&mdash;ah&mdash;ah&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely embarrassing to have
people refuse their money when it&rsquo;s offered them, and then
come the next day for it, when perhaps it isn&rsquo;t so
convenient to pay it&mdash;<i>very</i> embarrassing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, hotly: &ldquo;But I tell you I don&rsquo;t want the
<i>money</i>!&nbsp; I never wanted it, and wouldn&rsquo;t take it
on any account.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I thought you said you came to
get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;I said&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say&mdash;I
meant&mdash;that is&mdash;ah&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;He stops,
open-mouthed.</p>
<p><i>She</i>, quietly: &ldquo;I could give you part of the money
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh, whatever you like; it&rsquo;s
indifferent&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Please sit down while I write a
receipt.&rdquo;&nbsp; She places herself deliberately at the
table, and <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>opens her portfolio.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will pay you now,
Mr. Ransom, for the first six lessons you gave me&mdash;the ones
before you told me that I could never learn to do
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, sinking mechanically into the chair she indicates:
&ldquo;Oh, just as you like!&rdquo;&nbsp; He looks up at the
ceiling in hopeless bewilderment, while she writes.</p>
<p><i>She</i>, blotting the paper: &ldquo;There!&nbsp; And now
let me offer you a little piece of advice, Mr. Ransom, which may
be useful to you in taking pupils hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, bursting out: &ldquo;I never take
pupils!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Never take pupils!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
understand.&nbsp; You took <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, confusedly: &ldquo;I took you&mdash;yes.&nbsp; You
seemed to wish&mdash;you seemed&mdash;the case was
peculiar&mdash;peculiar circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, with severity: &ldquo;May I ask <i>why</i> the
circumstances were peculiar?&nbsp; I saw nothing peculiar about
the circumstances.&nbsp; It seemed to me it was a very simple
matter.&nbsp; I told you that I had always had a great curiosity
to see whether I could use oil paints, and I asked you a very
plain question, whether you would let me study with you.&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Was there anything wrong&mdash;anything
queer about my asking you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;No, no!&nbsp; Not at all&mdash;not in the
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you wish me to take the
lessons of you?&nbsp; If you didn&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t kind
of you to let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I was perfectly willing&mdash;very glad
indeed, very much so&mdash;certainly!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t your <i>custom</i> to
take pupils, you ought to have told me, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have
forced myself upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, desperately: &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t forcing
yourself upon me.&nbsp; The Lord knows how humbly grateful I
was.&nbsp; It was like a hope of heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Really, Mr. Ransom, this is very strange
talk.&nbsp; What am I to understand by it?&nbsp; Why should you
be grateful to teach me?&nbsp; Why should giving me lessons be
like a hope of heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I will tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, after a moment of agony: &ldquo;Because to be with
you&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Because I wished to be with you.&nbsp;
Because&mdash;<a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>those days in the woods, when you read, and
I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Painted on my pictures&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Were the happiest of my life.&nbsp;
Because&mdash;I loved you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Mr. Ransom!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Yes, I must tell you so.&nbsp; I loved you;
I love you still.&nbsp; I shall always love you, no matter
what&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;You forget yourself, Mr. Ransom.&nbsp; Has
there been anything in my manner&mdash;conduct&mdash;to justify
you in using such language to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;No&mdash;no&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Did you suppose that because I first took
lessons of you from&mdash;from&mdash;an enthusiasm for art, and
then continued them for&mdash;for&mdash;amusement, that I wished
you to make love to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;No, I never supposed such a thing.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m incapable of it.&nbsp; I beseech you to believe that no
one could have more respect&mdash;reverence&rdquo;&mdash;He
twirls his hat between his hands, and casts an imploring glance
at her.</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh, respect&mdash;reverence!&nbsp; I know
what they mean in the mouths of men.&nbsp; If you respected, if
you reverenced me, could you dare to <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>tell me, after my unguarded trust of
you during the past months, that you had been all the time
secretly in love with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, plucking up a little courage: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see that the three things are incompatible.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh, then you acknowledge that you did
presume upon something you thought you saw in me to tell me that
you loved me, and that you were in love with me all the
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, contritely: &ldquo;I have no right to suppose that
you encouraged me; and yet&mdash;I can&rsquo;t deny it
now&mdash;I was in love with you all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;And you never said a word to let me believe
that you had any such feeling toward me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;You would have parted from me without a
syllable to suggest it&mdash;perhaps parted from me
forever?&rdquo;&nbsp; After a pause of silent humiliation for
him: &ldquo;Do you call that brave or generous?&nbsp; Do you call
it manly&mdash;supposing, as you hoped, that <i>I</i> had any
such feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;No; it was cowardly, it was mean, it was
unmanly.&nbsp; I see it now, but I will spend my life in
repairing the wrong, if you will only let me.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>He
impetuously advances some paces toward her, and then stops,
arrested by her irresponsive attitude.</p>
<p><i>She</i>, with a light sigh, and looking down at the paper,
which she has continued to hold between her hands: &ldquo;There
was a time&mdash;a moment&mdash;when I might have answered as you
wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh! then there will be again.&nbsp; If you
have changed once, you may change once more.&nbsp; Let me hope
that some time&mdash;any time, dearest&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, quenching him with a look: &ldquo;Mr. Ransom, I
shall <i>never</i> change toward you!&nbsp; You confess that you
had your opportunity, and that you despised it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh! <i>not</i> despised it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Neglected it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Not wilfully&mdash;no.&nbsp; I confess that
I was stupidly, vilely,
pusillan&mdash;pusillan&mdash;illani&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;Monsly&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Thanks&mdash;&rsquo;mously unworthy of it;
but I didn&rsquo;t despise it; I didn&rsquo;t neglect it; and if
you will only let me show by a lifetime of devotion how dearly
and truly I have loved you from the first moment I drove that cow
away&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Mr. Ransom, I have told you that I <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>should
never change toward you.&nbsp; That cow was nothing when weighed
in the balance against your being willing to leave a poor girl,
whom you supposed interested in you, and to whom you had paid the
most marked attention, without a word to show her that you cared
for her.&nbsp; What is a cow, or a whole herd of cows, as
compared with obliging a young lady to offer you money that you
hadn&rsquo;t earned, and then savagely flinging it back in her
face?&nbsp; A yoke of oxen would be nothing&mdash;or a mad
bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I acknowledge it!&nbsp; I confess
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;And you own that I am right in refusing to
listen to you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, desolately: &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;It seems that you gave me lessons in order
to be with me, and if possible to interest me in you; and then
you were going away without a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, with a groan: &ldquo;It was only because I was
afraid to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh, is <i>that</i> any excuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;No; none.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;A man ought always to have
courage.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a pause, in which he stands before
her with <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>bowed head: &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing for me
but to give you this money.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, with sudden energy: &ldquo;This is too much!&nbsp;
I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, offering him the bank-notes: &ldquo;No; it is the
exact sum.&nbsp; I counted it very carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it; I can&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll never take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, standing with the money in her outstretched hand:
&ldquo;I have your word as a gentleman that you will take
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, gasping: &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;I will take
it&mdash;I will&rdquo;&mdash;He clutches the money, and rushes
toward the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-evening;
ah&mdash;good-by&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, calling after him: &ldquo;The receipt, Mr.
Ransom!&nbsp; Please sign this receipt!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>She</i>
waves the paper in the air.</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly!&nbsp; Where is
it&mdash;what&mdash;which&rdquo;&mdash;<i>He</i> rushes back to
her, and seizing the receipt, feels blindly about for the pen and
ink.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where shall I sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Read it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all&mdash;all
right&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;I insist upon your reading it.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a business transaction.&nbsp; Read it
aloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span><i>He</i>, desperately: &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>He</i> reads.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Received from Miss Ethel
Reed, in full, for twenty-five lessons in oil-painting, one
hundred and twenty-five dollars, and her hand, heart, and dearest
love forever.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>He</i> looks up at
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ethel!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, smiling: &ldquo;Sign it, sign it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, catching her in his arms and kissing her:
&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;<i>here</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, pulling a little away from him, and laughing:
&ldquo;Oh, oh!&nbsp; I only wanted <i>one</i> signature!&nbsp;
Twenty autographs are too many, unless you&rsquo;ll let me trade
them off, as the collectors do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;No; keep them all!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
think of letting any one else have them.&nbsp; One
more!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s quite enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i> frees herself, and retires beyond the table.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This unexpected affection&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;<i>Is</i> it
unexpected&mdash;seriously?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh, nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Yes, tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;I hoped&mdash;I
thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;that you might have been prepared for
some such demonstration on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span><i>She</i>: &ldquo;And why did you
think&mdash;hope&mdash;perhaps&mdash;<i>that</i>, Mr. Ransom, may
I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t, how should I have dared
to speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Dared?&nbsp; You were obliged to
speak!&nbsp; Well, since it&rsquo;s all over, I don&rsquo;t mind
saying that I <i>did</i> have some slight apprehensions that
something in the way of a declaration might be extorted from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Extorted?&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; He makes an
impassioned rush toward her.</p>
<p><i>She</i>, keeping the table between them: &ldquo;No,
no.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I merely wished to ask why you chose to
make me suffer so, after I had come to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Ask it across the table, then.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;I made you
suffer&mdash;I made you suffer&mdash;so that you might have a
realizing sense of what you had made <i>me</i> suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, enraptured by this confession: &ldquo;Oh, you
angel!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, with tender magnanimity: &ldquo;No; only a
woman&mdash;a poor, trusting, foolish woman!&rdquo;&nbsp; She
permits him to surround the table, with imaginable results.&nbsp;
Then, with her head on his shoulder: <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> let
me regret it, will you, darling?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never oblige
me to punish you again, dearest, will you?&nbsp; Oh, it hurt
<i>me</i> far worse to <i>see</i> your pain than it did you
to&mdash;to&mdash;feel it!&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other side of the
partition, <i>Mr. Grinnidge&rsquo;s</i> pipe falls from his lips,
parted in slumber, and shivers to atoms on the register.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>She</i> flies at the register with a
shriek of dismay, and is about to close it.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
wretch has been listening, and has heard every word!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, preventing her: &ldquo;What wretch?&nbsp;
Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear him, mumbling and
grumbling there?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Well, I swear!&nbsp; Cash value of
twenty-five dollars, and untold toil in coloring it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, listening with an air of mystification:
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Gummidge, Grimmidge&mdash;whatever you
called him.&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>She</i> arrests herself in
consternation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I <i>have</i> done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Done what?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Do you mean
to say that my friend Grinnidge&rsquo;s room is on the other aide
of the wall, and that you can hear him talk <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>through the
register?&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>She</i> preserves the silence of abject
terror.&nbsp; He stoops over the register, and calls down
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grinnidge!&nbsp; Hallo!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Hallo, yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, to <i>Miss Reed</i>: &ldquo;Sounds like the
ghostly squeak of the phonograph.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
<i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>: &ldquo;Smashed my pipe.&nbsp; Dozed off and
let it drop on this infernal register.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ransom</i>, turning from the register with impressive
deliberation: &ldquo;Miss Reed, may I ask <i>how</i> you came to
know that his name was Gummidge, or Grimmidge, or whatever I
called him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh, dearest, I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> tell
you!&nbsp; Or&mdash;yes, I had better.&rdquo;&nbsp; Impulsively:
&ldquo;I will judge you by myself.&nbsp; <i>I</i> could forgive
<i>you</i> anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, doubtfully: &ldquo;Oh, could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Everything!&nbsp; I had&mdash;I had better
make a clean breast of it.&nbsp; Yes, I had.&nbsp; Though I
don&rsquo;t like to.&nbsp; I&mdash;I listened!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Listened?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Through the register
to&mdash;to&mdash;what&mdash;you&mdash;were saying before
you&mdash;came in here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her head droops.</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Then you heard everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Kill me, but don&rsquo;t look
<i>so</i> at me!&nbsp; It was accidental at first&mdash;indeed it
was; and then I recognized your voice; and then I knew you were
talking about me; and I had so much at stake; and I did love you
so dearly!&nbsp; You <i>will</i> forgive me, darling?&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t as if I were listening with any bad
motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, taking her in his arms: &ldquo;Forgive you?&nbsp;
Of course I do.&nbsp; But you must change this room at once,
Ethel; you see you hear everything on the other side,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh, not if you whisper on this.&nbsp; You
couldn&rsquo;t hear <i>us</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; At a dubious
expression of his: &ldquo;You <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> hear us?&nbsp;
If you did, I can never forgive you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;It was accidental at first&mdash;indeed it
was; and then I recognized your voice; and then I knew you were
talking about me; and I had so much at stake; and I did love you
so dearly!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;All that has nothing whatever to do with
it.&nbsp; How much did you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, with exemplary meekness: &ldquo;Only what you were
saying before Grinnidge came in.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t whisper
then.&nbsp; I had to wait there for him while&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span><i>She</i>: &ldquo;While you were giving your good
resolutions a rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;While I was giving my good resolutions a
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;And that accounts for your determination to
humble yourself so?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;It seemed perfectly providential that I
should have known just what conditions you were going to exact of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t make light of it!&nbsp; I
can tell you it&rsquo;s a very serious matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;It was very serious for me when you
didn&rsquo;t meet my self-abasement as you had led me to expect
you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make fun!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
trying to think whether I can forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, with insinuation: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe
you could think better if you put your head on my
shoulder?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; Then I should forgive you
without thinking.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a season of reflection:
&ldquo;No, I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> forgive you.&nbsp; I never could
forgive eavesdropping.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s <i>too</i>
low.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, in astonishment: &ldquo;Why, you did it
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span><i>She</i>: &ldquo;But you began it.&nbsp; Besides,
it&rsquo;s very different for a man.&nbsp; Women are weak, poor,
helpless creatures.&nbsp; They have to use finesse.&nbsp; But a
man should be above it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;You said you could forgive me
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Ah, but I didn&rsquo;t know what
you&rsquo;d been doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, with pensive resignation, and a feint of going:
&ldquo;Then I suppose it&rsquo;s all over between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, relenting: &ldquo;If you could think of any reason
<i>why</i> I should forgive you&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, after consideration: &ldquo;Do you suppose Mr.
Grumage, or Grimidge, heard too?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;No; Grinnidge is a very high-principled
fellow, and wouldn&rsquo;t listen; besides, he wasn&rsquo;t
there, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Well, then, I will forgive you on these
grounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>He</i> instantly catches her to his
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;But these alone, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>, rapturously: &ldquo;Oh, on any!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i>, tenderly: &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll always be
devoted?&nbsp; And nice?&nbsp; And not try to provoke me?&nbsp;
Or neglect me?&nbsp; Or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He</i>: &ldquo;Always!&nbsp; Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span><i>She</i>: &ldquo;Oh, you dear, sweet, simple old
thing&mdash;how I <i>do</i> love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grinnidge</i>, who has been listening attentively to every
word at the register at his side: &ldquo;Ransom, if you

<p><i>Ransom</i>, about to comply: &ldquo;Oh, poor old man!&nbsp;

<p><i>Miss Reed</i>, preventing him: &ldquo;No!&nbsp; If he has
been vile enough to listen at a register, let him suffer.&nbsp;
Come, sit down here, and I&rsquo;ll tell you just when I began to
care for you.&nbsp; It was long before the cow.&nbsp; Do you
remember that first morning after you
arrived&rdquo;&mdash;<i>She</i> drags him close to the register,
so that every word may tell upon the envious Grinnidge, on whose
manifestations of acute despair, a rapid curtain descends.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
